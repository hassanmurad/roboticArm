PID Control of a Robotic Arm using the Tiva-C board


This project converts the quadrature pulses on the encoder in order to get the angular position of the arm. The whole arm is smoothened and optimized to reach a specified point using a PID control method. The widths of PWM pulses are determined according to a mapped Angular Position to Voltage formula which was created by modelling the DC motor and to get rid of any non-linearities.

If you have any questions, do let me know!
